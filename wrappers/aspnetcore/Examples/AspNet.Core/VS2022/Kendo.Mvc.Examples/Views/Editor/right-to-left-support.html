<h2 class="kd-title">Description</h2>
<p>The Telerik Core Editor supports right-to-left languages and rendering. All you have to do is to register the <b>kendo.rtl.min.css</b> file (located at Kendo.Mvc.Examples\Content\web installation folder) and wrap the editor in a container element with <b>k-rtl </b>class set for it, as demonstrated in this example.</p>
<p>More information on the right-to-left support of the components can be found in <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/accessibility/supporting-rtl-languages" target=\"_blank\">this topic</a>.</p>
