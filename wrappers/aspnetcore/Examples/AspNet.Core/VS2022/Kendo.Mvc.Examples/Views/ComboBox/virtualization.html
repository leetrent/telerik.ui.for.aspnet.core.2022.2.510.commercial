    The UI for ASP.NET Core ComboBox supports a virtualization feature which is useful for large data sets. As shown in the demo, it renders a fixed number of items at once and when scrolled, takes the rest of the items and displays them within the same format.
    To enable it, create Read and ValueMapper actions and set the desired number of items to be rendered.
