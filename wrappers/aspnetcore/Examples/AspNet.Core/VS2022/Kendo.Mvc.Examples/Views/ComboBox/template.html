    The Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core ComboBox offers options for templates to control the rendering of item, a selected value, or a pop-up header in the component.
    As shown in this demo, you can personalize the look and feel of the ComboBox and include images and other type of customized content with the Header and Item templates.
