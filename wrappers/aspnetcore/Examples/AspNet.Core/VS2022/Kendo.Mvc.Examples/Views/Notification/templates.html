    Using the templating feature of the Telerik Notification component you can customize the HTML elements rendered inside the notifications – add images, special content or other components.

    In the current demo you can see the implementation of Notification templates used together with their corresponding built-in notification types “info”, “error” and “success” (custom types are also supported).
