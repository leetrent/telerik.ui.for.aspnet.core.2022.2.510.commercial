    <p>The Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core ColorPicker component provides options for checking the color contrast ratio between two colors. Color contrast between text and background is important on web pages. It affects some people’s ability to perceive the information.</p>
    <p>This tool follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which are a series of recommendations for making the web more accessible.</p>
    <p>Regarding colors, the WCAG standard defines two levels of contrast ratio:</p>
    <ul><li>AA (minimum contrast)—The level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text.</li><li>AAA (enhanced contrast)—The level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text.</li></ul>
    <p>The example demonstrates how to display the Color Contrast Tool in the ColorPicker gradient popup.</p>
