    The Telerik PanelBar for ASP.NET Core provides a large set of API methods. In this demo you can see the functions in action choosing from expand/collapse of a panel, add or remove items and sub-items, choose where to add them â€“ before or after the selected on, as well as enable or disable a whole panel section.
