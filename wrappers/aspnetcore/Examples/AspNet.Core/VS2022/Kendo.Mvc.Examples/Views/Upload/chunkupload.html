    The Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core Upload component provides a chunk upload option which allows the user to submit multiple and large files. They are uploaded asynchronously with multiple requests to the server. As shown in the demo, the chunk upload is enabled by setting up the Async(a => a.ChunkSize()) option.
