    The UI ASP.NET Core Upload allows dragging and dropping files over a dedicated drop zone. When the user drags the file over the browser window, the drop zone appears and it gets highlighted when the user drags over the drop zone itself. After dropping the file in the dedicated drop area, the file is added to the upload queue. As demonstrated in this example, the drop zone is initialized from the DropZone property.
