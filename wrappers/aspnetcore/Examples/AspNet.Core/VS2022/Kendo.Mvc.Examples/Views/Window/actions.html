<p>
    If you define a non-recognized action name in the Ui for ASP.NET Core Window, that name is considered as a custom action. The demo example shows what is the approach to capture and handle click events for custom actions. The Window will generate a custom class for the action based on the name of the action â€“ <b>.Custom("custom")</b>.
    In this example the "k-i-custom" class is generated by adding "k-i-" to the name "custom". This class can be used to find the respective custom action.
