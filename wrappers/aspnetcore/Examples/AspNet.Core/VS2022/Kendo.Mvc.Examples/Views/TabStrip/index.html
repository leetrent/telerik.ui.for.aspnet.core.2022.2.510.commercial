    The Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core TabStrip is a component that renders a set of tabs which the user can select. Upon selection, the tabs open and show the content associated with each tab. The current demo shows a basic usage scenario for the TabStrip containing four tabs with the relevant information for each one and usage of animation effects when selecting through the tabs.
