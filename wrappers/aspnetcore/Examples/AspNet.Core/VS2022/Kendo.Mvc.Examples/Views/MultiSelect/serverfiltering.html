    The Telerik MultiSelect for ASP.NET Core offers server and client type of filtering which eases the searching process by narrowing down the items that the user is interested in. This example demonstrates the server filtering which is useful for rendering large sets of data and is configured by setting the ServerFiltering property to true.
