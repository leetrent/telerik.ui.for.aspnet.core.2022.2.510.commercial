<p>
    The Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core MultiSelect component supports a grouping feature which helps you organize predefined lists of values into logical groups.
</p>
<p>
    To enable grouping, define a <b>datasource</b> expression with a custom <b>DataSource</b> configuration and specify the field by which the MultiSelect will be grouped. In the current demo, the multiselect component data is grouped by <b>Country</b>, <b>.Group(g => g.Add("Country", typeof(string)))</b> and under each group are listed all corresponding customers for that country.
