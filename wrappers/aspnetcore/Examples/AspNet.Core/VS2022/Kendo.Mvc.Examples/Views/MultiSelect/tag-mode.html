<p>
    The Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core MultiSelect provides two tag modes which is specified in the TagMode property as Single or Multiple. When you interact with the demo, you will see that the first example displays the number of chosen elements in a single item, while the second one showcases separately all items, that you have selected.
